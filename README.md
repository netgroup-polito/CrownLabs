# CrownLabs

CrownLabs is a set of services that can deliver **remote computing labs** through a **per-user virtual machine**.

Instructors can provision a set of virtual machines, properly equipped with the software required for a given lab (e.g., compilers, simulation software, etc).

Each student can connect to its own set of (remote) private environments without requiring any additional software, just a simple Web browser. No space problems on the student hard disk, no troubles in setting up the environment required to support multiple subjects on the same machine, and more.

In addition, each student can share his remote desktop with his groupmates, enabling multiple students to complete their labs in a team.

Finally, CrownLabs supports also instructors, who can connect to the remote desktop of the student and play directly with his environment, e.g., in case some help is required.

## Install

CrownLabs can be installed on any Kubernetes cluster, although with a non-negligible degree of adaptation.
This would require a non-trivial knowledge of how Kubernetes (and the wonderful world of microservices) works. 
No magic install procedure is unfortunately available (yet).

In a nutshell, you have to install all the components with your own custom configuration files, which may largely depend upon your physical install.
A huge degree of customization is possible in this respect: pure data-link vs. BGP-based load balancing, the number (and capabilities) of your servers, the desired degree of high availability, integration with external authentication servers, creation of admin/user credentials, your own secrets to protect the internal communication among the components.

Do not expect to complete this task in a few hours; likely, you may need several days, or even more.
Help is available on our Slack channels.
