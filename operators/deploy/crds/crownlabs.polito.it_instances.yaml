                  The meaning of this flag is different depending on whether the instance
                  refers to a persistent environment or not. If the first case, it allows to
                  stop the environment (e.g. the underlying VM) without deleting the associated
                  disk. Setting the flag to true will restart the environment, attaching it
                  to the same disk used previously. Differently, if the environment is not
                  persistent, it only tears down the exposition objects, making the instance
                  effectively unreachable from outside the cluster, but allowing the
                  subsequent recreation without data loss.
