# CrownLabs run-time configuration

Crownlabs has several components, mostly operatos, which may need to be configured with appropriate labels and/or other information in order to achieve the intended behaviour.

This section of the documentation presents the possible configuration options for the most important components:
- [Explicit selection of the target node](node-selection.md) (bypassing the default scheduling rules)
- [Defining quotas per workspace and per user](resource-quota.md)
